How To use:

Pass the image you wish to sort as a command line argument, and the program does the rest!
The file that is output will be named "OriginalFileNameSorted.jpg", where OriginalFileName is, well, the original files name.

I haven't tested this extremely well, so there are chances for bugs. If you find any, please let me know!
